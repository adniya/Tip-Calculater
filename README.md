## Overview

Tippy computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.
